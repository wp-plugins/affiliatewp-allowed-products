Allows only specific products to generate commission in AffiliateWP.

== Description ==

> This plugin requires [AffiliateWP](http://affiliatewp.com/ "AffiliateWP") in order to function.

This plugin allows you to choose which products on your site should earn commission for your affiliates. Although AffiliateWP allows you to disable commission on products (for supported integrations), it can be cumbersome to disable commission on every single one, especially if you have hundreds of products. Install and activate this plugin, enter some product IDs, and only these products will generate commission when purchased via a referral URL.
